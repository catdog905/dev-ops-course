# Continuous Integration Best Practices

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Path Filtering

- Both workflows include `paths` filtering for the `push` event, ensuring that the workflows are only triggered when changes occur within specific directories (`app_scala/**`). This helps optimize CI/CD pipeline by running only relevant jobs.

### 2. Proper Workflow Naming

- Workflows are named descriptively (`Scala CI` and `Docker-scala`), making it easy for developers to understand the purpose of each workflow.

### 3. Versioning of External Actions

- External actions used in the workflows specify specific versions (`@v3`, `@96383f45573cb7f253c731d3b3ab81c87ef81934`, etc.), ensuring that the workflows are stable and not affected by breaking changes in future versions of the actions.

### 4. Use of Environment Variables

- Environment variables are utilized effectively to parameterize and configure various aspects of the workflows (`REGISTRY`, `IMAGE_NAME`, etc.), allowing for flexibility and customization.

### 5. Secrets Management

- Secrets such as Docker Hub credentials (`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`) and Snyk API token (`SNYK_TOKEN`) are stored securely as GitHub secrets and accessed within the workflows using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax.

### 6. Conditional Steps

- Conditional execution of steps based on specific conditions (`if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'`) ensures that certain actions, like Docker image pushing and signing, only occur on specific events (`push`).

### 7. Permissions Configuration

- Permissions are explicitly configured for jobs (`permissions: contents: read, packages: write, id-token: write`) to specify the level of access required for performing certain actions, enhancing security and control.

### 8. Use of Third-Party Actions

- Third-party actions are utilized for specific tasks such as setting up Docker Buildx, logging into Docker registry, and signing Docker images. This leverages existing tools and expertise from the community to streamline CI/CD processes.

### 9. Cache Management

- Caching mechanisms are employed (`cache: 'sbt'`, `cache-from`, `cache-to`) to optimize build times by caching dependencies and build artifacts, reducing redundant work in subsequent workflow runs.

### 10. Metadata Extraction

- Docker metadata extraction is performed (`docker/metadata-action`) to retrieve tags and labels associated with Docker images, enhancing visibility and manageability of Docker artifacts.
