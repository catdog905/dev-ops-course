## Coding Standards and Best Practices

- **Code Structure**: Followed PEP 8 guidelines to ensure code is readable and maintainable.
- **Type Hints**: Utilized Python type hints to improve code readability and prevent potential bugs.
- **Dependency Management**: Managed dependencies using `requirements.txt` for reproducibility and easier setup.

## Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Implemented unit tests using FastAPI's TestClient to simulate API requests and validate responses.

## Code Quality

- **Linting**: Used linters (e.g., flake8) to identify and fix stylistic issues and potential errors.

## Best Practices in Web Application

- **Security**: Implemented security best practices, using FastApi preset
- **Scalability**: Designed the application for scalability, employing FastAPI that support build-in concurrency.
